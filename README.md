# Life: In Pieces

> *"Hope is not just a feeling – it’s a choice that repeats, over and over, through every stage of life."*

**[Life: In Pieces](https://juhighosh007.github.io/life-in-pieces/)** is a narrative-driven, stage-based game created for the **Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program 2025 Game Jam**.  
The player journeys through **childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and old age** — each phase offering unique mechanics, challenges, and perspectives.

## 🎯 Game Concept

Hope is catching joy even when danger falls beside it.  
In adolescence, it’s navigating obstacles knowing you might stumble — but pushing forward anyway.  
In adulthood, it’s balancing exhaustion with ambition, holding on to the belief that balance is still possible.  
In old age, it’s weaving through drifting blocks — fragments of memories, regrets, and fading strength — still finding ways to move ahead.  

Through evolving mechanics and changing outcomes, the game invites players to experience how resilience takes different forms in every chapter of life.
